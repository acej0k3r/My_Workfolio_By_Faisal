Hello, for the party thats viewing my workfolio please note the following. 

Majority of the work within this repository is just demos and are not offcial builds. There are applications, and individual small projects within this repository that follows this rule. Hence, the code quality control isnt implemented for example some API keys may not be properly hidden away however these API keys are free and doesnt cause any damage to any parties if stolen, misused, abused, etc. 

All the work within the repository are coded by me and there was no copy pasting of code. That bieng said there may be concepts that are similiar to my code and I have taken inspiration of and may have modified it to fit my purposes. Therefore, all of the work is orignial and developed my Author Md A Faisal (Faisal Chowdhury)

Thank you, and feel free to ask any questions regarding this through my emails which is in the resume.
